## ðŸš€ Installation

Utilify can be easily installed using the main package managers, with full support for [JSR](https://jsr.io/) â€” the official Deno module registry, also compatible with Node.js and other modern runtimes.

```bash
npm install @utilify/core
# or
yarn add @utilify/core
# or
pnpm add @utilify/core
# or (Deno)
deno add jsr:@utilify/core
```

### About JSR
[JSR](https://jsr.io/) is the official Deno module registry. It allows you to install modern packages with a single command, even in environments like Node.js, Bun, or npm-compatible runtimes.

#### JSR Usage Examples:
```bash
# Deno
deno add jsr:@utilify/core
# npm
npx jsr add @utilify/core
# bun
bunx jsr add @utilify/core
# pnpm
pnpm add jsr:@utilify/core
# yarn
yarn add jsr:@utilify/core
```

The package is compatible with ES modules (ESM) and can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

```ts
// ESM

```

```js
// CJS
const { isString, chunk, formatDate } = require('@utilify/core');
