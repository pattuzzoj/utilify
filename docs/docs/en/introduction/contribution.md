### Contribute with Consistency

Avoid adding generic, duplicate, or impractical functions.
Functions that already exist natively in the language should also be avoided — unless they offer real improvements in safety, usability, or case coverage.
Contributions that follow this standard will be prioritized.
**We seek quality — not quantity.**
