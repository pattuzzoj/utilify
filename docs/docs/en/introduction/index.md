# Welcome to Utilify

**Utilify** was born out of my real need for a utility function library that is modern, strongly typed, and safe for the JavaScript ecosystem.

Amidst countless fragmented options, I found a gap for tools that deliver:

- **Ease of use**, with clear and straightforward APIs;
- **Clear and accessible documentation**, so learning and consulting are quick and uncomplicated;
- **Robust typing**, ensuring safety and autocomplete in TypeScript;
- **Lightweight**, so as not to compromise performance or bloat bundles;
- **Reliability**, avoiding unexpected behaviors common in generic utilities.

We offer a wide range of utilities, organized into well-defined scopes, making navigation and quick access in the documentation easier.

That's why Utilify is not just another collection of helpers: it's a solution designed for developers who demand precision, consistency, and agility in daily development, without sacrificing simplicity.

Here, the priority is to deliver exactly what you need—nothing more—in a single, modern package ready to integrate with any JavaScript or TypeScript project.
