# defer

The `defer` function executes a callback function as soon as the current call stack is cleared by using a resolved Promise. This ensures that the code execution is postponed until the JavaScript engine has finished executing the synchronous code.

## Syntax

```typescript
function defer(callback: () => void): void;
```

### Parameters

| Name       | Type                  | Description                                    |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `callback` | `() => void`           | The function to be executed asynchronously.     |

### Return

| Type       | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `void`     | Does not return anything. The `callback` is invoked in the next event loop cycle. |

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic use of defer

```typescript
console.log('Before');

defer(() => {
  console.log('Executed after');
});

console.log('After');
```

**Output:**
```
Before
After
Executed after
```

### Example 2: Using defer to delay execution

```typescript
const delayedAction = () => {
  console.log('Delayed action');
};

defer(delayedAction);
```

**Output:**
```
Delayed action
```

The `delayedAction` function will be executed after the current code in the call stack completes.

## Notes

- `defer` uses a Promise to schedule the function execution, ensuring it happens asynchronously after the synchronous code completes.
- This is useful when you want to ensure a function is called only after the rest of the synchronous code has been executed.

## Code

::: code-group
```typescript
function defer(callback: () => void): void {
  Promise.resolve().then(callback);
}
```

```javascript
function defer(callback) {
  Promise.resolve().then(callback);
}
```
