# Environment <Badge type="tip" text="1.0.2" />

The **Environment** category contains utility functions that help detect and identify the environment in which the code is running, whether it's in the browser, server, or within different types of workers. These functions are useful for providing environment-specific behaviors.

## Installation

To install the environment utilities, use one of the following commands, depending on your package manager:

::: code-group
```bash [npm]
npm install @utilify/environment
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @utilify/environment
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @utilify/environment
```
:::

Once installed, you can import the functions into your project, using either ESM or CJS.

## Usage

This library supports both ESM and CJS module systems.

::: code-group

```typescript [esm]
import { isBrowser } from '@utilify/environment'; 
```

```javascript [cjs]
const { isBrowser } = require('@utilify/environment');  
```
